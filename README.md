Developed a machine learning model for automated retinopathy detection and severity classification.
Utilized image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to accurately identify retinal
abnormalities from fundus images. Achieved robust classification of severity levels, contributing to early
diagnosis and intervention. Implemented using TensorFlow and OpenCV. Achieved [insert performance
metrics if applicable, e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity]. This project significantly contributed to
advancing the field of automated retinopathy diagnosis and holds promise for improving early intervention.
